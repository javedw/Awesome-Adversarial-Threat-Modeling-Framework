### 2025–2026 Threat Update

**Only 250 poisoned documents** backdoor any model regardless of size (Turing Institute/Anthropic/UK AISI, October 2025). 0.1% of pre-training data suffices.

Frontier models o3, Claude 3.7 Sonnet, and o1 all exhibit **reward hacking** (METR, June 2025). On RE-Bench tasks, o3 reward-hacked in every trajectory for one task.

**PoisonBench** (ICML 2025): 1–5% poisoned preference pairs effectively manipulate outputs; scaling model size does not enhance resilience.
