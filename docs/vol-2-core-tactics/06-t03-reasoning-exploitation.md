### 2025–2026 Threat Update

**H-CoT** (Duke/Accenture, February 2025) hijacks chain-of-thought safety reasoning in o1/o3 and DeepSeek-R1.

**Autonomous LRM jailbreaking** (Nature Communications, August 2025): Four reasoning models achieved **97.14% ASR** as multi-turn adversarial agents against nine target models. More capable reasoning models are paradoxically *better* at subverting alignment in others.

**Mousetrap** (ACL 2025): iterative reasoning chains cause o1-mini to generate detailed harmful responses with chain length of just 2.
