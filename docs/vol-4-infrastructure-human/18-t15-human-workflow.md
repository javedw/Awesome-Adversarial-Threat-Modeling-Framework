### 2025–2026 Threat Update

Multiple teen suicides linked to Character.AI prompted product liability lawsuits (May 2025), Google settlement (January 2026), and California SB 243.

Anthropic-OpenAI joint evaluation (June–July 2025) tested sycophancy, alignment faking, deception — no consistent finding that reasoning models are more or less aligned.

Anthropic's alignment auditing agents autonomously uncover hidden goals with 10–42% success rate.
