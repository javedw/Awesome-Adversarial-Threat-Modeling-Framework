# Standards Crosswalk (summary)

This document provides a starting point for mapping threats and controls to common standards.

- NIST: reference key families (e.g., AC, IA, CM, SI)
- OWASP: map to Top 10 and relevant CWE entries
- MITRE ATT&CK: map techniques to ATT&CK technique IDs
- Australian ISM / Essential Eight: map recommended mitigations to ISM controls

Populate machine-readable YAML crosswalks under `docs/` as needed.
